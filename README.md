# Python Tutorial
This project will include basic functionality of common operations that are needed from most Python developers.

The purpose is to get users up and running on their own analyses as quickly as possible, and includes step-by-step code snippets (and associated explanations) for:

- Bringing data into a pandas DataFrame through a CSV and API call
- Manipulating raw data to make it appropriate for analysis

*This is a work in progress. Hoping to add in the below features:*
- A "do-it-yourself" branch that asks questions that require the user to perform the operations covered
- A branch for loading in a PDF, and programmatically extracting data from it.
