That amount must be\\nmultiplied by a factor to determine the credit amount, as\\nfollows: 1.0 for 2013-2018, 0.75 for 2019, 0.50 for 2020, and\\n0.25 for 2021.\\n\\nThe credit is capped at $6,000 for the following: OEM or\\nconverted AFVs, HEVs, PHEVs, idle reduction technologies, and\\npower source replacements. The credit for PHEV conversions is\\ncapped at $7,500 until January 1, 2014, and $6,000 thereafter. A\\nperson who claimed a tax credit in previous years for the\\npurchase or lease of Model Year 2004 and newer HEV may claim an\\nadditional credit for the conversion of the same vehicle to a\\nPHEV. The purchase of a used vehicle may qualify if the vehicle\\nwas not previously registered in Colorado. Credits may not be\\ncarried forward and a taxpayer will receive a refund for the\\nexcess credit.\\n\\nCredits for CNG, electric, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles\\npurchased, leased, or converted during the 2013 tax year may be\\ndetermined in one of two different ways.

The MOU aims to encourage OEMs to offer functional and affordable light- and medium-duty NGVs, aggregate state vehicle procurement through a joint request for proposals (RFP), boost private investment in natural gas fueling infrastructure, and encourage greater coordination between state and local agencies. In July 2012, National Association of State Procurement Officials coordinated the solicitation of a joint RFP, which the Oklahoma Department of Central Services (DCS) issued on behalf of the MOU signatories, as well as additional states. As a result, state fleets have access to more affordable NGVs through dealerships now included in state vehicle purchasing bids. For more information, including awarded vehicles by state and vehicle purchase information for state fleets, see the DCS <a href=\"https://www.ok.gov/dcs/solicit/app/solicitationDetail.php?conID=410\">Statewide Contract for NGVs</a> solicitation page.',\n",
